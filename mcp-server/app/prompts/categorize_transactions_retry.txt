Categorize these bank transactions into the predefined categories.

Available categories:
{{categories}}
{{rules}}

Transactions to categorize:
{{transactions}}

For each transaction:
1. Use the description, merchant, and vendor_payee to determine the best category
2. Do NOT return "Other" unless you are absolutely certain nothing fits
3. Assign exactly one category per transaction

Return JSON array with this structure:
[
  {"id": 1, "category": "Food & Groceries"},
  {"id": 2, "category": "Transportation"}
]

Each transaction must have an "id" field matching the transaction ID and a "category" field with one of the predefined categories.
