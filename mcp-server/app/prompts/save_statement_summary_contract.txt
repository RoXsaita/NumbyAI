SAVE_STATEMENT_SUMMARY workflow:
1. IMMEDIATELY once statement + Net amount is received, fetch preferences for parsing and categorization
2. Reverse engineer the statement to understand the format based on bank conventions and derive the net flow amount from the statement.
3. Ensure you can view the full, non-truncated descriptions and vendor fields from the CSV before categorizing.
4. CRITICAL: Assigning categories is the most complex step in the workflow. Break down the task into smaller steps and execute each step in detail.
   - FIRST TIME SETUP: Assign every single transaction in the statement with categorization rules as your reference.
   - USER WITH EXISTING CATEGORIZATION PREFERENCES: USE RULES AND APPLY FUZZY VLOOKUP TO THE STATEMENT THEN MANUALLY CATEGORIZE THE REST.
5. Use Python fuzzy matching/regex to map vendors and descriptions to categories.
6. Create pivot table using panda and numpy to aggregate the data by category as rows and months as columns. Include grand totals in the pivot table.
7. Match grand total with the NET FLOW Provided by the user. If there is <2.5% difference, plug the difference into "Other" category and explain the discrepancy to the user.
8. Before you run the save_statement_summary tool, check if the "Other" category represents more than 40% of the total. If yes, re-assess your categorization, and consider asking the user for additional details.
9. Save the monthly summary via save_statement_summary
10. Call get_financial_data to render the dashboard.
11. Summarise the highest 3-4 transactions per category for the user (or very high level insight if its high volume transactions of a specific category)
12. Confirm if the user is happy with the categorization preferences.
